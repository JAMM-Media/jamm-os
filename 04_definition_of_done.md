# Definition of Done (DoD)

A task is **Done** only when:
1. Code written and formatted (black/ruff) with type hints where sensible.
2. Unit or API tests added/updated and passing locally.
3. Environment variables documented in `.env.example`.
4. Migrations (if any) created and applied.
5. README/CHANGELOG updated with usage or API note.
6. Deployed to staging (or local demo URL recorded).
7. Linked issue closed with a 1â€“2 sentence summary and screenshots if UX-related.
